## About Me

I gained my skills and experience through the ALX Software Engineering Program, where I graduated as a full-stack engineer. I am passionate about software development and continually seek to enhance my expertise. My GitHub profile reflects this journey, showcasing projects and roles that highlight my proficiency in various programming languages and frameworks. I am currently focused on revamping my profile to stand out during my job search and demonstrate my capabilities.

My skill set spans from front-end development, including JavaScript and React, to back-end development with Node.js and Express. I am committed to creating professional, well-structured projects, and I am eager to further enrich my GitHub profile with compelling HTML markups and a modern, polished format.
